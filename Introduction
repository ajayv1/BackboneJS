There was a need to create SPAs in a structured manner and this created a need for JavaScript frameworks and libraries that
provided some structure to single page applications.
Currently there are quite a few Open Source JavaScript frameworks available that help us solve the problem of spaghetti code. 
These frameworks let us design our applications in a structured manner.
Backbone uses MV* framework.

Model :
When we talk about any MV* pattern, model is undoubtedly the most important part of the architecture/application. 
Its the model that contains all the application data. Along with keeping the data the model class performs various set of 
actions on the data. 
Actions like possibility to validate the data, possibility to persist the data, defining access to various parts of data 
contained in the model (access control).
